					<h1>My Philosphy</h1>
					Curious and always thinking, "How do I make this better". Always focused on aesthetic beauty and simplicity. I want to discover and go beyond the boundaries of technology and its conventional interfaces. I love to mix technology and design-arts rather than choose one or the other. I love brainstorming with different types of people to create new and radical ideas and build them, mixing the "real" and virtual world.<br><br> I'm interested in HCI, Interaction design, UX design, wearable technology, interactive experiences and Internet of things. One of my last obsessions is to mix electronics and art. I love discovering new ways of interaction between people and their environment. I have a Computer Science background and Design focused on HCI and UX Design. I worked as a Multimedia Engineer for 2 years (using Unity, augmented reality, video production, computer graphics and 3d modeling). I've been exploring the interaction between people and computers with different types of interfaces and designs. Some of the projects I developed and designed are interactive prototypes related with augmented reality, remote collaboration and technology of entertainment.
